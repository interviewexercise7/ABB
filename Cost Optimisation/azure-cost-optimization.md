# Azure Cost Optimization Report

## Executive Summary
This report outlines cost optimization opportunities identified through Azure Advisor analysis and provides specific recommendations for resource optimization. Implementation of these recommendations could result in significant cost savings while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Compute Resources Optimization

#### Virtual Machines
- **Right-sizing Opportunities**
  - Identify underutilized VMs (CPU/Memory < 30% over 14 days)
  - Recommend downsizing to appropriate VM sizes
  - Potential savings: 20-50% per instance

- **Reserved Instance Opportunities**
  - Convert eligible VMs to 1-year or 3-year Reserved Instances
  - Applicable for stable, long-running workloads
  - Potential savings: Up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go pricing

- **Schedule Management**
  - Implement start/stop schedules for non-production environments
  - Use Azure Automation for automated scheduling
  - Potential savings: Up to 70% for dev/test environments

### 2. Storage Optimization

#### Blob Storage
- **Access Tier Optimization**
  - Move infrequently accessed data to cool storage tier
  - Implement lifecycle management policies
  - Potential savings: Up to 50% on storage costs

- **Redundancy Level Review**
  - Evaluate current redundancy requirements
  - Consider switching from GRS to LRS for non-critical data
  - Potential savings: Up to 23% on storage costs

#### Managed Disks
- **Disk Size Optimization**
  - Identify oversized disks with low utilization
  - Recommend appropriate disk sizes
  - Potential savings: 20-40% per disk

### 3. Database Services

#### Azure SQL Database
- **Elastic Pools Implementation**
  - Group databases with variable workloads
  - Share resources across multiple databases
  - Potential savings: Up to 50% compared to individual databases

- **Performance Tier Review**
  - Analyze DTU/vCore usage patterns
  - Recommend right-sizing opportunities
  - Potential savings: 20-40% per database

### 4. Networking

#### Bandwidth Optimization
- **Review Data Transfer Patterns**
  - Optimize data transfer between regions
  - Use Azure Content Delivery Network where applicable
  - Potential savings: Up to 60% on data transfer costs

#### ExpressRoute Optimization
- **Circuit Capacity Review**
  - Analyze bandwidth utilization
  - Right-size circuit capacity
  - Potential savings: 15-30% on networking costs

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Immediate Implementation)
1. Start/Stop schedules for non-production VMs
2. Right-size underutilized VMs
3. Implement storage lifecycle management

### Priority 2 (Within 3 Months)
1. Convert eligible VMs to Reserved Instances
2. Implement Elastic Pools for compatible databases
3. Optimize storage access tiers

### Priority 3 (Within 6 Months)
1. Review and optimize network architecture
2. Implement comprehensive tagging strategy
3. Setup automated cost monitoring

## Monitoring and Governance

### Cost Management Practices
1. Implement resource tagging for cost allocation
2. Set up budget alerts and spending thresholds
3. Regular review of Azure Advisor recommendations

### Governance Recommendations
1. Establish cost optimization policies
2. Define resource provisioning standards
3. Implement automated compliance checking

## Expected Outcomes

### Financial Impact
- Estimated total savings: 25-40% of current spend
