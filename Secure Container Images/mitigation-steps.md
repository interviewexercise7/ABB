# Container Security Mitigation Steps

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update Base Image
Update the nginx base image to the latest secure version that includes patches for CVE-2024-2345:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.22.2-1
```

### 2. Package Updates
Apply the following package updates to address critical and high vulnerabilities:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    openssl=1.1.1u-1+deb11u1 \
    glibc=2.31-13+deb11u8 \
    curl=7.74.0-1.3+deb11u12
```

### 3. Security Best Practices Implementation

#### 3.1 Implement Least Privilege Access
- Run container as non-root user
- Add to Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
RUN useradd -r -s /bin/false nginx
USER nginx
```

#### 3.2 Enable Security Features
Add security options to container runtime:
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

#### 3.3 Configure Resource Limits
Add to container deployment:
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
```

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Implement Continuous Scanning**
   - Enable automatic scanning in Azure Security Center
   - Set up alerts for new critical/high vulnerabilities
   - Configure automatic rebuild triggers when new vulnerabilities are detected

2. **Image Management**
   - Use explicit image tags instead of 'latest'
   - Implement image signing
   - Set up automated image updates for security patches

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Enable runtime security monitoring
   - Configure logging and monitoring
   - Set up alerts for suspicious container activity

4. **Policy Enforcement**
   - Implement admission controls
   - Define and enforce security policies
   - Regular security audits and compliance checks

## Verification Steps

After implementing mitigations:
1. Re-run container scan to verify fixes
2. Test application functionality
3. Verify security controls are active
4. Monitor for any security alerts

## Additional Security Layers

1. **Network Security**
   - Implement network policies
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Enable TLS for all communications

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement RBAC
   - Use service accounts with minimal permissions
   - Regular access review and cleanup

Remember to test all changes in a staging environment before applying to production.
