Quality Gate Status: Failed

### 1. Critical Code Vulnerabilities
1. SQL Injection Vulnerability
   - Severity: Critical (Blocker)
   - Location: Controllers/UserController.cs:156
   - Description: Raw SQL query with string concatenation
   ```csharp
   var query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '" + username + "'";
   ```
   - Resolution: Use parameterized queries with Entity Framework

   var user = context.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Username == username);
   ```
   - Status: Fixed

2. Insecure Deserialization
   - Severity: Critical
   - Location: Services/DataService.cs:89
   - Description: Using BinaryFormatter for deserialization
   ```csharp
   BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
   var obj = formatter.Deserialize(stream);
   ```
   - Resolution: Replace with JSON.NET or System.Text.Json
   ```csharp
   var obj = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<MyType>(jsonString);
   ```
   - Status: In Progress

### 2. Security Hotspots
1. Weak Password Hashing
   - Location: Services/AuthService.cs:45
   - Description: Using MD5 for password hashing
   - Resolution: Implement proper password hashing with salt
   ```csharp
   using var hasher = new PasswordHasher<User>();
   var hashedPassword = hasher.HashPassword(user, password);
   ```
   - Status: Fixed

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Location: Views/Home/DisplayUser.cshtml:23
   - Description: Unencoded user input in Razor view

   ```
   - Resolution: Use proper HTML encoding
   ```csharp
   @Html.Encode(Model.UserComment)
   ```
   - Status: Fixed

### 3. Code Smells
1. Hard-coded Credentials
   - Severity: Critical
   - Location: appsettings.json:12
